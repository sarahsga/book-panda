# Book Panda

This was my first ReactJS project, designed and developed by me to practice my knowledge in ReactJS. It is based on a hypothetical book shop called Book Panda, where you can purchase books online after reading reviews by other customers.

Please visit the Book-Panda website [here](https://book-panda.firebaseapp.com/categories).

## Tools and Technologies
I have used the following tools for the development of Book-Panda

1. ReactJS (frontend)
2. React Router
3. Redux
4. SASS
5. Firebase (for deployment)

**NOTE: The website does not use any templates - all the UI design and development work was done by me.**

## What's Next
This project was just the beginning (2018). I have since been working full-time professionally as a Full Stack MERN developer. Please have a look at [my portfolio](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pvkvKoakeZmOHJ2YV8RJIdk9fezNbYTppGi-qcQMaXU/edit?usp=sharing) for some work samples.
